## Approaches
In this lab, we did the same problem with different parameter. We apply different scheduling policies such as static and dynamic. Also we applied coarse and fine granularity in the code to observed the output. 

Approach 1) Coarse Block Division
Approach 2) Dynamic Scheduling Policy
Approach 3) FIne Block Division
Approach 4) Static Scheduling Policy
